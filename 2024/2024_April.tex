\subsubsection*{Neural Network}
The Neural Network is constructed to approximate the function $g(\theta^{\mu}_{\text{i,j}})$ in Eq. \ref{eq:control_variate}. The Neural Network is trained to minimize the naive loss function $\mathcal{L}$, which can be defined as,
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{\text{a}=1}^{N}\{O([\theta^{\mu}_{\text{i,j}}]_a) - f([\theta^{\mu}_{\text{i,j}}]_a)\}^2
\end{equation} 
where $N$ is the number of samples, $O$ is the observable, and $f$ is the Control Variate.

\subsection*{Single Plaquette Model in 2D} 

The Neural Network is trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of $0.001$ and a batch size of $32$. The Neural Network is trained for $100$ epochs.
